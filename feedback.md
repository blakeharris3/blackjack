### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

The above key will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!




## Project Workflow - 3

Blake, excellent work with this project! Your README was very detailed and provided a lot of context and narrative to your project. Thank you for the wireframe! You also did a very good job updating your README as your project evolved.

## Technical Requirements - 3

Congratulations on meeting all of the technical requirements Blake! Taking on black jack as well as any card game is tough task for a project one goal, so congratulations for getting this far.

## Creativity - 3

Your game design was very creative, especially with the dynamically rendering buttons during different game states. Also, good job adding a card table as well!

## Code Quality - 2.5

Overall your code was immaculate. Thank you for removing all commented out code and console logs. You also provided plenty of comments that explained what each component of your code does. 

Here are a couple suggestions I would like to offer for future reference:
- As a good practice, I recommend adding a text title to your title tag in your html.
- Also, I would recommend naming your images directory “imgs”, instead of “Project”.
- Another good practice is it to add .DS_Store to your .gitignore file, so they don’t get pushed to github.

## Deployment - 3

You application was successfully deployed! Congratulations Blake! Also, thank you for adding a link to your deployed project in your repo.

## Total 14.5/15

You did very well for your first project Blake, you’re clearly demonstrating your ability to quickly implement what you’ re learning in class. Thank you for staying engaged with the content and your classmates.
